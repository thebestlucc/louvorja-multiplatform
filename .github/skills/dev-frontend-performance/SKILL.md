# Dev Frontend Performance Testing (Gate 6)

## Overview

Ensure all frontend pages meet **Core Web Vitals** thresholds, achieve **Lighthouse Performance > 90**, maintain **bundle size within budget**, and minimize **client component** usage.

**Core principle:** Performance is a feature. Users on slow devices and connections deserve a fast experience. Performance budgets are enforced, not suggested.

<block_condition>
- LCP > 2.5s on any page = FAIL
- CLS > 0.1 on any page = FAIL
- INP > 200ms on any page = FAIL
- Lighthouse Performance < 90 = FAIL
- Bundle size increase > 10% without justification = FAIL
</block_condition>

## CRITICAL: Role Clarification

**This skill ORCHESTRATES. Frontend QA Analyst Agent (performance mode) EXECUTES.**

| Who | Responsibility |
|-----|----------------|
| **This Skill** | Gather requirements, dispatch agent, track iterations |
| **QA Analyst Frontend Agent** | Run Lighthouse, measure CWV, analyze bundles, audit components |

---

## Standards Reference

**MANDATORY:** Load testing-performance.md standards via WebFetch.

<fetch_required>
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/frontend/testing-performance.md
</fetch_required>

---

## Step 1: Validate Input

```text
REQUIRED INPUT:
- unit_id: [task/subtask being tested]
- implementation_files: [files from Gate 0]

OPTIONAL INPUT:
- performance_baseline: [previous metrics for comparison]
- gate5_handoff: [full Gate 5 output]

if any REQUIRED input is missing:
  → STOP and report: "Missing required input: [field]"
```

## Step 2: Dispatch Frontend QA Analyst Agent (Performance Mode)

```text
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "ring:qa-analyst-frontend"
  model: "opus"
  prompt: |
    **MODE:** PERFORMANCE TESTING (Gate 6)

    **Standards:** Load testing-performance.md

    **Input:**
    - Unit ID: {unit_id}
    - Implementation Files: {implementation_files}
    - Baseline: {performance_baseline or "N/A"}

    **Requirements:**
    1. Measure Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP) on all affected pages
    2. Run Lighthouse audit (Performance score > 90)
    3. Analyze bundle size change vs baseline
    4. Audit 'use client' usage (should be < 40% of components)
    5. Detect performance anti-patterns (bare <img>, useEffect for fetching, etc.)
    6. Verify sindarian-ui imports are tree-shakeable

    **Output Sections Required:**
    - ## Performance Testing Summary
    - ## Core Web Vitals Report
    - ## Handoff to Next Gate
```

## Step 3: Evaluate Results

```text
Parse agent output:

if "Status: PASS" in output:
  → Gate 6 PASSED
  → Return success with metrics

if "Status: FAIL" in output:
  → Dispatch fix to implementation agent (ring:frontend-engineer)
  → Re-run performance tests (max 3 iterations)
  → If still failing: ESCALATE to user
```

## Step 4: Generate Output

```text
## Performance Testing Summary
**Status:** {PASS|FAIL}
**LCP:** {value}s (< 2.5s)
**CLS:** {value} (< 0.1)
**INP:** {value}ms (< 200ms)
**Lighthouse:** {score} (> 90)
**Bundle Change:** {+X%} (< 10%)

## Core Web Vitals Report
| Page | LCP | CLS | INP | Status |
|------|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| {page} | {value} | {value} | {value} | {PASS|FAIL} |

## Bundle Analysis
| Metric | Current | Baseline | Change | Status |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| Total JS (gzipped) | {size} | {size} | {change}% | {PASS|FAIL} |

## Server Component Audit
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total .tsx files | {count} |
| Client components | {count} |
| Client ratio | {percent}% (< 40%) |

## Anti-Pattern Detection
| Pattern | Occurrences | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Bare <img> | {count} | {PASS|FAIL} |
| useEffect for fetching | {count} | {PASS|FAIL} |
| Wildcard sindarian imports | {count} | {PASS|FAIL} |

## Handoff to Next Gate
- Ready for Gate 7 (Code Review): {YES|NO}
- Iterations: {count}
```

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations. Gate-specific:

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Works fine on my machine" | Your machine ≠ user's device. Measure objectively. | **Run Lighthouse** |
| "We'll optimize later" | Performance debt compounds. Fix during development. | **Meet thresholds now** |
| "Bundle size doesn't matter" | Mobile 3G users exist. Every KB matters. | **Stay within budget** |
| "Everything needs use client" | Server components reduce JS. Audit first. | **Minimize client components** |
| "next/image is too complex" | next/image gives free optimization. Always use it. | **Use next/image** |
| "Lighthouse 85 is close enough" | 90 is the threshold. 85 = FAIL. | **Optimize to 90+** |
